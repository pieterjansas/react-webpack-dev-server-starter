It could completely destroy your current grocery shopping habits. In theory, your groceries should be waiting for you at the store when you arrive 30 minutes later. Wouldn't that be awesome? Our chatbot prototype is the beginning of this new way of shopping. The chatbot gives you the opportunity to tell him what you prefer, but it also asks specific questions. In the backend it filters through all the available recipes, until one is chosen. It integrates with the system of a big Belgian supermarket chain. Whether you want dinner, lunch, breakfast, dessert, a quick meal, a fancy meal, a summery meal, something with fish, something with steak… you can ask for it and the bot will respond and recommend your perfect recipe."
